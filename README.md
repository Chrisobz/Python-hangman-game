# Python-hangman-game
Simple traditional game of hangman made on Pycharm.

This project aims to make the user guess words in order to not lose the game. The program is based on the traditional family game called hangman. The user would get a word that is missing some or all its letters and would have to guess what the word is. The version of the game I am making will have different categories that the user can choose, so the game would be easier. With different categories, guesses would become more accurate so the usersâ€™ chance of losing would be less.
